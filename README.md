### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were 94 Vine reviews and 40,471 non-Vine reviews

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 48 5 star Vine reviews and 15,663 5 star non-Vine reviews.

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
51.06% of Vine reviews were 5 stars and 38.7% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars

## Summary: 
With paid reviews nearly 13% more likely to get a 5 star review, it does appear that there is positivity bias. We should perform the same analysis on all star levels to help confirm this.
